# LoRaProMini

**This project is a WIP!**

A LoRaWAN node for The Things Network, based on a Arduino Pro Mini and RFM96W/SX1276 LoRa module. The PCB is installed in a solar lamp and supplied with power from it. Between the data transmissions, the Arduino, LoRa module and all sensors go into (deep) sleep mode to save power.
